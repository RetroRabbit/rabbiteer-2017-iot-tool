# NodeMCU File Tool

A tool for working with your NodeMCU. Allows one to perform basic functions with the NodeMCU.

**Note: Needs the [*Rabbiteer Edition* NodeMCU firmware*](https://github.com/RetroRabbit/rabbiteer-2017-iot-firmware)** This is because it takes advantage of the improved line editing and echo on/off functions.

## Getting Started
Check out [releases](https://github.com/RetroRabbit/rabbiteer-2017-iot-tool/releases) and download the one for your platform. Run the executable inside.

This is what you'll get:
